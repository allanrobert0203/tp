# :mag:findr

`findr` is a **desktop app for recruiters to manage candidates, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, `findr` can get your candidate management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
   - Check if Java is already installed in the command terminal by typing in: `java -version`. 
   - If the version shown is Java 17 or higher, you will be able to run `findr` smoothly. 
   - If not, download and install java 17 from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).
   - **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `findr.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your `findr` app.

4. Open a command terminal, navigate into the folder you put the jar file in using the `cd` command (change directory).
   - For example, if you put the jar file in C:\Users\Recruiter\findr\, use the following command in the terminal:
> cd C:\Users\Recruiter\findr\

5. Use the `java -jar findr.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Start-Ui.png)

5. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all candidates.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a candidate named `John Doe` to the candidate list.

   * `delete 3 from/Candidates` : Deletes the 3rd candidate from Candidate stage shown in the current list.
   
   * `sort` : Sorts the candidate list alphabetically.

   * `clear all` : Deletes all candidates.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.
2. If you want to start a new contact list from scratch using `findr`, use the `clear all` command, which will clear all the sample data from `findr`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a candidate: `add`

* `[TAG]` has to be created using [tag commands](#commands-for-managing-tags--) before adding to candidates. 
* Candidate is created with date added as current date and rating as `UNRATED`.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

### Editing a candidate : `edit`

Edits an existing candidate in the candidate list.

Format: `edit INDEX from/STAGE [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the candidate will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Valid stages: `Candidates`, `Contacted`, `Interviewed`, `Hired` (case-insensitive)

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2 from/Contacted` deletes the 2nd candidate in the Contacted stage of the kanban board.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1 from/Candidates` deletes the 1st candidate in the Candidates stage in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete 3 from/interviewed` deletes the 3rd candidate in the Interviewed stage (case-insensitive).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

The index shown on each candidate card in the kanban board corresponds to their position within that specific stage column. Use this index when moving candidates.
</div>

### Rating a candidate : `rate`

Sets or updates a candidate's rating.

Format: `rate INDEX from/STAGE r/RATING`

* Tag names must be alphanumeric and unique.
* Tag colour must be 6 digit hexadecimal beginning with `#`

Examples:
* `tagadd tn/backend tc/Engineering tcol/#1F75FE td/Backend specialist` adds new tag called backend with specified fields

#### Deleting a tag definition : `tagdelete`

#### Listing all tag definitions : `taglist`

Shows all tag definitions in the catalogue with their category, colour, and description.

Format: `taglist`

Example:
* `taglist`


### Saving the data

Candidate list data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Candidate list data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/findr.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **NOTE:**
JSON file will only be created after first command run.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **CAUTION:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, `findr` will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the `findr` to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### New Features `[coming in v2.0]`
#### Head Hunting Platform Integration
* Integration with applications and platforms such as LinkedIn etc.

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous `findr` home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
